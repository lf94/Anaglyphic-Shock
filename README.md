# Anaglyphic Shock
## Browsing the web in a higher dimension, *now*.

Anaglyphic Shock is a chrome extension (works in Opera too) that allows you to convert side-by-side images to anaglyph. This opens up a huge range of media to anaglyph enthusiasts.

I started Anaglyphic Shock because I was frustrated with not being able to use cheap anaglyph glasses with *a lot* of anaglyph media. Additionally the amount of anaglyph media that exists is very tiny compared to side-by-side media, which other devices like the Oculus Rift use. Being able to use this media on the fly gives purpose to anaglyph once again.

I love anaglyph as a 3D format because it's just so robust. It works on LCDs, CRTs, and even paper.

### Support
If you would like to support me (because I have a real job to do too), you can [donate to me](https://gratipay.com/~lf94/) through the fantastic service, [gratipay](https://gratipay.com/).

## Features
The power of Anaglyphic Shock doesn't stop there though. A lot of the time users of anaglyph have issues with their glasses working with media because colors don't properly match up. In Anaglyphic Shock, you can adjust the lens filters so they match your glasses. Just right-click the Anaglyphic Shock icon in your web browser bar, and click "Options". Dragging the sliders will apply modifiers to the filters.

### Supported Filters
Currently Anaglyphic Shock only supports red and cyan/blue. The reason for this is the algorithm uses what are called "reference colors". I'm uncertain how to make other reference colors at this time.

Support for any anaglyph combination is a major goal for Anaglyphic Shock. Expect it as soon as possible.

### Supported Media
Anaglyphic Shock currently only supports static images and the first frame of gifs. This is a limit of the implementation. It would be nice to get gifs and even HTML5 video working. Don't expect it to happen though.

## Theory
Anaglyphic Shock uses the Eric Dubois algorithm. You can read about his stereoscopic research on [his Ottawa University website](www.site.uottawa.ca/~edubois/anaglyph/).
